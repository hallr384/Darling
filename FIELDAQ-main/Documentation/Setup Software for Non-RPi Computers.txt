Process for setting up the code base to be run on non-RaspberryPi computers. This is useful for development and testing.
Specific instructions for installation will not be provided in this guide, as specific procedures will differ from
device to device and version to version. Look up how to do so for your device online. 

1. Install python. Version 3.9.5 is the latest version that has been confirmed to work, but new versions may also work. 
2. Install virtualvenv. 
3. Create a python environment with virtualvenv and enter it. Use this environment anytime you are working on this project. 
4. Install kivy. Version 2.0.0 is the latest confirmed version, but newer versions may also work. kivy-garden is also required
   but is usually installed with kivy. 
5. Install numpy. 
6. Navigate to the FIELDAQ/Granusoft/src directory in a terminal and run "python3.9 main.py" (replace 3.9 with whatever 
   version you are using). 

The box gui should now load onto your screen. If not, here are a few troubeshooting suggestions:
- Check that your graphics drivers are properly installed and up to date. This has caused issues in the past. 
- If using zsh when installing kivy on linux, the installation commands may not work as listed. Try using bash instead. 
- Some documentation has suggested that matplotlib and kivy-garden's graph is required. Try installing matplotlib and graph. 
  (Graph is installed with "garden install graph").
- Although the code has been confirmed to work with python 3.9.5 and kivy 2.0.0, it was developed on python 3.5.3 and kivy 
  1.11.0.dev0. Try installing these older versions and running the code. 

Once you get the code running on your device, please update this guide with any useful information you learned during the 
installation process.
